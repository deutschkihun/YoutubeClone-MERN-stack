Hello


This project is about clone coding for youtube web page 


1. (Recommended) use git clone to copy this project in your IDE, you can download and add your file but "git clone" is definitely faster than that.
2. add dev.js in folder : server -> config. 
3. In this js file add your mongoDB URL (include ID and password)
4. Do "npm install" for backend dependencies
5. go into "client folder" and install "npm install"
6. go into Folder : client -> Config.js and add your api key
7. compile this project in your terminal with "npm run dev", it can compile backend and frontend together !!
